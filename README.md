# Filmorate

Imagine that you decide to relax and spend the evening watching a movie. Delicious food is already being prepared, your favorite blanket curled up comfortably on an armchair - and you still haven't chosen what to watch!

There are many films - and every year there are more and more. The more of them, the more different estimates. The more ratings, the more difficult it is to make a choice. However, this is not the time to give up! Filmorate is a service that works with movies and user ratings, and returns the top 5 movies recommended for viewing. Now neither you nor your friends will have to think for a long time what to see in the evening.
